Project Summary:
This project calculates the age of animals in human years. 
The user can select from 3 types: 
1. Dog

After selecting the type, the user needs to enter the age of the animal, and then click Submit.

The output shows the age of the animal in human years.

1 Cow year = 7 Human Years
1 Horse year = 3 Human Years
